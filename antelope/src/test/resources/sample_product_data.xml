    <longDescription>SynopsisYour hands steady as you lock onto your target, the scope trained on this unsuspecting man's temple. Your breathing slows as time seems to wait for the fatal moment when you squeeze the trigger. Your aim is sure, your resolve unwavering; the man crumples to the ground before you even hear the shot. You claim yet another clean kill without an ounce of remorse as you reload and scan for the next target. When these men overthrew the democratic government of Isla Trueno, they had no idea of the consequences. Their fate is sealed; but will your covert efforts be enough to overthrow a ruthless despot? Walk through the jungles of South America as the silent and invisible hand of death. By the time your enemies learn of your presence it's already too late &#151; you are a Ghost Warrior.  Sniper: Ghost Warrior takes you on a thrilling journey as you influence the tide of government from the shadows. Your enemy won't see it coming as you work with a spotter, slow your breathing and calculate for the effects of weather and distance falloff. You have an arsenal of weapons at your disposal, but usually one bullet is all you need. Watch as you take your targets out with precision in Bullet Cam mode, or engage in real-time assault sections. The action never ends with plenty of different play opportunities including sniper vs. sniper, real-time tactical assault and fixed machine gun combat scenarios.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisYou watch as your teammate rolls the dice and hold in a sigh of regret. One number less and you would rake it in big time. You eye the board and weigh your odds; it's a close game and the mogul to your right is swallowing properties like water. With the right throw and a little bit of luck, you may still score big. You hold three railroads in the palm of your hand: one more and you hit the jackpot. You grab the ivory cubes and toss them down, waiting for the fateful number. Will you finally score the Reading Railroad or be doomed to a rent-paying future?  Monopoly Streets reinvigorates the classic game of fortune in a whole new format. Explore the streets of your favorite town as you journey from the cheap motels of Baltic Avenue to the ritzy Boardwalk suites and more. Watch your fortunes rise and fall as your player headquarters change from a luxurious mansion to a dilapidated hut &#151; and back, if you're lucky. Feeling competitive? Use your street smarts to auction off your properties and break your rivals' banks, or even challenge players worldwide in exciting online play. You set the standards with the opportunity to set and save house rules to play longer or shorter, and the ability to create your own Xbox avatar so you don't have to get stuck playing as the thimble ever again. Round the board in classic game mode, explore new game twists in Monopoly City and Monument City or download extra themed boards and tokens online for changing adventures that keep you passing "Go" over and over again. Jump into the excitement of this classic game, but watch out &#151; once you reach the top, there's nowhere to go but back down.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisThe bright blue sky stretches before you as you bank to the left, dodging a rain of enemy fire. Your plane smoothly turns and you crane your neck to get a look at the evil drone dogging you. A burst of gunfire startles you but you have no time for surprise as your teammate's plane plummets out of the air, right wing on fire and falling fast. A bright white parachute blossoms and you breathe a sigh of relief but it's short-lived. Now it is just you and them. How will you fight off the overwhelming odds? It will take unflagging courage and the skills of an expert to beat these villains in fast-paced aerial combat. Do you have what it takes?  MySims: SkyHeroes takes you into the great blue above to defeat a dastardly foe. As you lead the resistance against Morcubus, you will find yourself face-to-face with impressive odds and evil drones. Come out on top with the help of a friend in split-screen co-op play, or face the enemy on your own in dogfights, air raids, rescue missions and more. Epic boss battles will strain even the most expert flyers, but you have talent and technology at your back. As you progress through the levels you can upgrade your wings, switch out your engine and paint your plane with camouflage to gain the advantage over your enemies. Take the dogfight online in massive multiplayer battles against up to 10 players. With a plane like yours, the sky's the limit on what you can accomplish.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisYou hurtle down the field, cleats barely digging into the dirt &#151; almost running on air. Between your lightning-quick feet, the ball moves in perfect unison with your body. As one unit, you pivot left &#151; eking past the limbs of defenders, then dive right &#151; just avoiding a pummeling collision and break away &#151; sprinting, flying down the open field. This could be the break to thrust your team into victory and you into legendary status. Only you could pull off a maneuver quite like this. Your skills are in place, your talent is pure &#151; can you blast the ball past the keeper and capture glory?  When you lace up your cleats in FIFA Soccer 11, you step into the shoes of soccer greats with more realism and more dead-on accuracy than ever before. Dribble, pass and score in the exact style of the player you're emulating &#151; and even celebrate like him when it's all over, thanks to the all-new Personality+ feature. Maneuver tight turns and dribble through defenses like Barcelona's Iniesta; deliver crisp, creative passes like Real Madrid's Kaka, and anticipate offensive attacks like Juventus' Chiellini. Advances in controls, AI and realism mean swift passes, new pass types, gritty 360&#176; collisions and a new goalkeeper intuition factor. Create electric tournament experiences of your dreams as you craft your own teams, customize crowd chants and even hear your name announced over the speakers. Get in on the action online, fight to rise to the top of leaderboards and compare stats with your friends. How will you shape your soccer legacy?</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisYou've been drafted and now it's time for you to travel the globe, fighting to protect Allied interests from the expansion of the Axis powers. You'll be placed in the heart of World War II's deadliest combat zones as you fight from the desert sands of northern Africa to the ravaged streets of Russian cities, and from the islands of the South Pacific to the beaches of Normandy. Relive some of history's most brutal battles on foreign soil as you strive to preserve justice, honor and freedom around the world.   Call of Duty: The War Collection thrusts you into the vicious brutality and raw energy of World War II with Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3 and Call of Duty: World at War. In the sequel to the award-winning Call of Duty, Call of Duty 2 lets you choose your role, explore open-ended battlefields and employ whatever tactics you want to accomplish your missions. Immerse yourself in more intense and realistic battles than ever before with the COD 2 engine. Prepare to storm the beaches of Normandy during the Allies' most harrowing military operation of WWII in Call of Duty 3. Close-quarter battle mechanics place you in fierce hand-to-hand and face-to-face combat against the German forces, while the dramatic story is told through Call of Duty's signature cinematic intensity. Assume the role of a U.S. Marine or a Russian soldier during the waning days of the Second World War in Call of Duty: World at War. Experience the heart-pounding, intense conflict across multiple continents &#151; from deadly swamp ambushes to tree-top snipers and fearless Kamikaze attacks, the action explodes off the screen as the battle for the world rests in your hands.</longDescription>

Perilous mountains, arid deserts and thick forests threaten your safety at every turn as you speed through the extreme Seacrest County landscape &#151; but the biggest hazard is hot on your tail. A cop chases you in reckless pursuit &#151; a friend of yours until you turned away from the law. You feel the bullets from his high-power weapons shattering your glass and whizzing past your ear, but you stare at the course ahead as you twist the steering wheel and throttle ahead. It's a heart-stopping Hot Pursuit and your life's in danger at every moment. But you can't slow down now &#151; freedom is just a few maneuvers away, and you have just one concern: the Need for Speed.  You've raced before, but you've never been in a chase like Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit. This time, you can experience both the thrill of the chase and the rush of the escape all in one day as you get behind the wheel as both a cop and a law-breaking racer. All your races can be real-life competitions when you connect with your friends for online multiplayer action and compare performance and stats to up the stakes. Who will come out on top? In this Hot Pursuit, you have to prove you have the ability, guts and the Need for Speed.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisLights are flashing through the dark, the air is hot and heady, the bass is throbbing and the dance floor is flooded with people. Discs spin wildly under your able fingers as you craft the blistering beats that drive the crowd. You're a master DJ and the club is at your fingertips. Your music is an enchantment, casting a spell over the entire dance floor, but you must keep your concentration &#151; you have to scratch, mix and blast the beats in just the right way to keep the party going. In this scene, music is king and you're the DJ Hero.  Return to the turntable for more music-mixing magic than ever before as you spin together the hottest tracks blazing up the charts and legendary club anthems from the biggest artists in pop, dance and hip hop, including Dr. Dre, The Chemical Brothers, Kanye West, Deadmau5, Lady Gaga, Rihanna and more than 85 others. Use the huge, all-new catalog of songs in DJ Hero 2 to create brand-new beats of your own, or scratch and sample more than 70 speaker-blowing mashups from the hottest DJs and producers around the world. This time around, the turntable magic is a full-out party with all-new social modes that pit you against your spinning rivals or pair you with your rapper friends. Accumulator, Checkpoints and Streakers let you prove who is the best DJ in the house when you challenge your friends in multiplayer modes. Take your mix-master skills to the next level when you hit the road and work your way up to the top of a major entertainment empire in the all-new Empire mode. Scratch, mix and sample on the acclaimed DJ Hero turntable, while a friend grabs the mic and unleashes vocal talents along with on-screen lyrics. Transform your house into a house party with Party Play mode that lets the mixes play themselves, and allows you to jump-in/jump-out to seize control and play along without ever stopping the music. Break into the industry, climb the charts and fill the dance floors &#151; if you have the rhythm, the swagger and the technique to take your beats to the top.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisYour hands steady as you lock onto your target, the scope trained on this unsuspecting man's temple. Your breathing slows as time seems to wait for the fatal moment when you squeeze the trigger. Your aim is sure, your resolve unwavering; the man crumples to the ground before you even hear the shot. You claim yet another clean kill without an ounce of remorse as you reload and scan for the next target. When these men overthrew the democratic government of Isla Trueno, they had no idea of the consequences. Their fate is sealed; but will your covert efforts be enough to overthrow a ruthless despot? Walk through the jungles of South America as the silent and invisible hand of death. By the time your enemies learn of your presence it's already too late &#151; you are a Ghost Warrior.  Sniper: Ghost Warrior takes you on a thrilling journey as you influence the tide of government from the shadows. Your enemy won't see it coming as you work with a spotter, slow your breathing and calculate for the effects of weather and distance falloff. You have an arsenal of weapons at your disposal, but usually one bullet is all you need. Watch as you take your targets out with precision in Bullet Cam mode, or engage in real-time assault sections. The action never ends with plenty of different play opportunities including sniper vs. sniper, real-time tactical assault and fixed machine gun combat scenarios.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisYou watch as your teammate rolls the dice and hold in a sigh of regret. One number less and you would rake it in big time. You eye the board and weigh your odds; it's a close game and the mogul to your right is swallowing properties like water. With the right throw and a little bit of luck, you may still score big. You hold three railroads in the palm of your hand: one more and you hit the jackpot. You grab the ivory cubes and toss them down, waiting for the fateful number. Will you finally score the Reading Railroad or be doomed to a rent-paying future?  Monopoly Streets reinvigorates the classic game of fortune in a whole new format. Explore the streets of your favorite town as you journey from the cheap motels of Baltic Avenue to the ritzy Boardwalk suites and more. Watch your fortunes rise and fall as your player headquarters change from a luxurious mansion to a dilapidated hut &#151; and back, if you're lucky. Feeling competitive? Use your street smarts to auction off your properties and break your rivals' banks, or even challenge players worldwide in exciting online play. You set the standards with the opportunity to set and save house rules to play longer or shorter, and the ability to create your own Xbox avatar so you don't have to get stuck playing as the thimble ever again. Round the board in classic game mode, explore new game twists in Monopoly City and Monument City or download extra themed boards and tokens online for changing adventures that keep you passing "Go" over and over again. Jump into the excitement of this classic game, but watch out &#151; once you reach the top, there's nowhere to go but back down.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisThe bright blue sky stretches before you as you bank to the left, dodging a rain of enemy fire. Your plane smoothly turns and you crane your neck to get a look at the evil drone dogging you. A burst of gunfire startles you but you have no time for surprise as your teammate's plane plummets out of the air, right wing on fire and falling fast. A bright white parachute blossoms and you breathe a sigh of relief but it's short-lived. Now it is just you and them. How will you fight off the overwhelming odds? It will take unflagging courage and the skills of an expert to beat these villains in fast-paced aerial combat. Do you have what it takes?  MySims: SkyHeroes takes you into the great blue above to defeat a dastardly foe. As you lead the resistance against Morcubus, you will find yourself face-to-face with impressive odds and evil drones. Come out on top with the help of a friend in split-screen co-op play, or face the enemy on your own in dogfights, air raids, rescue missions and more. Epic boss battles will strain even the most expert flyers, but you have talent and technology at your back. As you progress through the levels you can upgrade your wings, switch out your engine and paint your plane with camouflage to gain the advantage over your enemies. Take the dogfight online in massive multiplayer battles against up to 10 players. With a plane like yours, the sky's the limit on what you can accomplish.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisYou hurtle down the field, cleats barely digging into the dirt &#151; almost running on air. Between your lightning-quick feet, the ball moves in perfect unison with your body. As one unit, you pivot left &#151; eking past the limbs of defenders, then dive right &#151; just avoiding a pummeling collision and break away &#151; sprinting, flying down the open field. This could be the break to thrust your team into victory and you into legendary status. Only you could pull off a maneuver quite like this. Your skills are in place, your talent is pure &#151; can you blast the ball past the keeper and capture glory?  When you lace up your cleats in FIFA Soccer 11, you step into the shoes of soccer greats with more realism and more dead-on accuracy than ever before. Dribble, pass and score in the exact style of the player you're emulating &#151; and even celebrate like him when it's all over, thanks to the all-new Personality+ feature. Maneuver tight turns and dribble through defenses like Barcelona's Iniesta; deliver crisp, creative passes like Real Madrid's Kaka, and anticipate offensive attacks like Juventus' Chiellini. Advances in controls, AI and realism mean swift passes, new pass types, gritty 360&#176; collisions and a new goalkeeper intuition factor. Create electric tournament experiences of your dreams as you craft your own teams, customize crowd chants and even hear your name announced over the speakers. Get in on the action online, fight to rise to the top of leaderboards and compare stats with your friends. How will you shape your soccer legacy?</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisYou've been drafted and now it's time for you to travel the globe, fighting to protect Allied interests from the expansion of the Axis powers. You'll be placed in the heart of World War II's deadliest combat zones as you fight from the desert sands of northern Africa to the ravaged streets of Russian cities, and from the islands of the South Pacific to the beaches of Normandy. Relive some of history's most brutal battles on foreign soil as you strive to preserve justice, honor and freedom around the world.   Call of Duty: The War Collection thrusts you into the vicious brutality and raw energy of World War II with Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3 and Call of Duty: World at War. In the sequel to the award-winning Call of Duty, Call of Duty 2 lets you choose your role, explore open-ended battlefields and employ whatever tactics you want to accomplish your missions. Immerse yourself in more intense and realistic battles than ever before with the COD 2 engine. Prepare to storm the beaches of Normandy during the Allies' most harrowing military operation of WWII in Call of Duty 3. Close-quarter battle mechanics place you in fierce hand-to-hand and face-to-face combat against the German forces, while the dramatic story is told through Call of Duty's signature cinematic intensity. Assume the role of a U.S. Marine or a Russian soldier during the waning days of the Second World War in Call of Duty: World at War. Experience the heart-pounding, intense conflict across multiple continents &#151; from deadly swamp ambushes to tree-top snipers and fearless Kamikaze attacks, the action explodes off the screen as the battle for the world rests in your hands.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisFasten your seatbelt and get ready to drive like your life depends on it. Perilous mountains, arid deserts and thick forests threaten your safety at every turn as you speed through the extreme Seacrest County landscape &#151; but the biggest hazard is hot on your tail. A cop chases you in reckless pursuit &#151; a friend of yours until you turned away from the law. You feel the bullets from his high-power weapons shattering your glass and whizzing past your ear, but you stare at the course ahead as you twist the steering wheel and throttle ahead. It's a heart-stopping Hot Pursuit and your life's in danger at every moment. But you can't slow down now &#151; freedom is just a few maneuvers away, and you have just one concern: the Need for Speed.  You've raced before, but you've never been in a chase like Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit.

Perilous mountains, arid deserts and thick forests threaten your safety at every turn as you speed through the extreme Seacrest County landscape &#151; but the biggest hazard is hot on your tail. A cop chases you in reckless pursuit &#151; a friend of yours until you turned away from the law. You feel the bullets from his high-power weapons shattering your glass and whizzing past your ear, but you stare at the course ahead as you twist the steering wheel and throttle ahead. It's a heart-stopping &lt;b&gt;Hot Pursuit&lt;/b&gt; and your life's in danger at every moment. But you can't slow down now &#151; freedom is just a few maneuvers away, and you have just one concern: the &lt;b&gt;Need for Speed&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You've raced before, but you've never been in a chase like &lt;b&gt;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit&lt;/b&gt;. This time, you can experience both the thrill of the chase and the rush of the escape all in one day as you get behind the wheel as both a cop and a law-breaking racer. All your races can be real-life competitions when you connect with your friends for online multiplayer action and compare performance and stats to up the stakes. Who will come out on top?

    <longDescription>SynopsisLights are flashing through the dark, the air is hot and heady, the bass is throbbing and the dance floor is flooded with people. Discs spin wildly under your able fingers as you craft the blistering beats that drive the crowd. You're a master DJ and the club is at your fingertips. Your music is an enchantment, casting a spell over the entire dance floor, but you must keep your concentration &#151; you have to scratch, mix and blast the beats in just the right way to keep the party going. In this scene, music is king and you're the DJ Hero.  Return to the turntable for more music-mixing magic than ever before as you spin together the hottest tracks blazing up the charts and legendary club anthems from the biggest artists in pop, dance and hip hop, including Dr. Dre, The Chemical Brothers, Kanye West, Deadmau5, Lady Gaga, Rihanna and more than 85 others. Use the huge, all-new catalog of songs in DJ Hero 2 to create brand-new beats of your own, or scratch and sample more than 70 speaker-blowing mashups from the hottest DJs and producers around the world. This time around, the turntable magic is a full-out party with all-new social modes that pit you against your spinning rivals or pair you with your rapper friends. Accumulator, Checkpoints and Streakers let you prove who is the best DJ in the house when you challenge your friends in multiplayer modes. Take your mix-master skills to the next level when you hit the road and work your way up to the top of a major entertainment empire in the all-new Empire mode. Scratch, mix and sample on the acclaimed DJ Hero turntable, while a friend grabs the mic and unleashes vocal talents along with on-screen lyrics. Transform your house into a house party with Party Play mode that lets the mixes play themselves, and allows you to jump-in/jump-out to seize control and play along without ever stopping the music. Break into the industry, climb the charts and fill the dance floors &#151; if you have the rhythm, the swagger and the technique to take your beats to the top.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>Learn more about Homefront. (Flash demo) SynopsisHome used to be where the heart was. America used to be free. Now, home is nothing but a bleak landscape of walled towns and abandoned suburbs, where high school stadiums have become detention centers and shopping malls shelter armored attack vehicles. Fear and despair have crept into the United States that you knew and loved. Worldwide conflict, dwindling resources and economic crisis have taken their toll; and now, in 2027, the savage, nuclear-armed Greater Korean Republic clenches the US in a brutal occupation. But the enemy forgot one little thing about the USA: they may have seized our land and weakened our state, but no one can weaken the spirit of the American people.   Not since George Washington led the patriots in the Revolutionary War has America fought a battle so vital to the freedom of the nation and so close to the hearts of the people. Not since then have we had to band together to protect our Homefront. Take the front lines alongside the colorful characters of the Resistance as you employ daring guerrilla tactics, commandeer military vehicles and unleash epic warfare across sprawling battlefields with first-person sharpshooting action. The heart-pounding, hair-raising exhilaration of the struggle springs to life when you take the fight online and experience multiplayer infantry, helicopter and drone battles the likes of which you've never seen. Enter a ghost town where the residents have been relocated to nearby labor camps in the "Suburb" Xbox 360-exclusive multiplayer map. Featuring empty houses and buildings, this infantry- and drone-only map offers extensive cover locations while rooftops and tree houses make for ideal sniper locations. Mask your fear, take your weapon in hand and bear the title "American" with pride: this is the call to save your Homefront.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisIt has been more than 50 years since the Red Faction resistance and the Marauder allies liberated the Red Planet from the brutal Earth Defense Force &#151; however, that harmony is once again threatened. A massive Terraformer that supplies Mars with its Earth-like air and water has been destroyed, causing the once-balanced atmosphere to transform to chaos. The Colonists have been forced to flee underground and begin their lives beneath the surface. Darius Mason, the grandson of Martian Revolution heroes Alec Mason and Samanya, runs a dangerous, yet lucrative business carrying out jobs that others fear to do. When Darius is tricked into entering an old Marauder temple, he reopens a mysterious shaft &#151; releasing a long-sleeping evil that unleashes Armageddon across Mars. Only Darius and the Red Faction can protect the Colonist and Marauder settlements and save mankind from the evil that envelops the Red Planet.  Red Faction: Armageddon places you in the role of Darius Mason, a man born of Colonist and Marauder blood, who must save mankind from an unspeakable evil that has resurfaced. In the latest installment of the Red Faction franchise, you must travel across the storm-blasted Red Planet &#151; and below the surface as you take up arms against a terrifying new force that threatens the sake of mankind. Will you be able to uphold your family's tradition of fighting for the freedom of Mars to protect the settlements against this mysterious lethal force?</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisHe's the most ruthless crime lord to ever prowl the streets of the City by the Bay. His name is Charles Jericho, and he certainly did not bring his heart to San Francisco. Now the fate of the sunny city rests in the hands of one man: a detective, a hero, a Driver. John Tanner has put hundreds of criminals behind bars and chased injustice out of many a city, but this mission poses a threat like no other &#151; and could be his last. Step into the driver's seat as the hardened detective and get ready for a relentless manhunt that could end either with the restoration of justice or the setting of the sun on the Golden Gate Bridge forever.  Driver San Francisco puts the wheel back into your hands in the next installation of the classic racing saga. In this battle of good and evil, your car is your weapon; and with a huge arsenal of more than 130 vehicles to choose from, you have endless power within your grasp. Handle your cars with the unique style that established the Driver series as a quintessential chase experience, with an all-new twist. Take the wheel with more control than ever, harnessing the incredible ability to instantly Shift to the exact car you need &#151; at the exact moment you need it. When you spot an enemy a block ahead, swap to a high-powered vehicle and throttle ahead to stop his getaway. When an opponent threatens to drive you off the road, take command of his vehicle and force his demise. Experience an even more enhanced Shift in the six online game modes, transporting yourself across miles in the blink of an eye with the ability to swap locations.

His name is Charles Jericho, and he certainly did not bring his heart to San Francisco. Now the fate of the sunny city rests in the hands of one man: a detective, a hero, a &lt;b&gt;Driver&lt;/b&gt;. John Tanner has put hundreds of criminals behind bars and chased injustice out of many a city, but this mission poses a threat like no other &#151; and could be his last. Step into the driver's seat as the hardened detective and get ready for a relentless manhunt that could end either with the restoration of justice or the setting of the sun on the Golden Gate Bridge forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Driver San Francisco&lt;/b&gt; puts the wheel back into your hands in the next installation of the classic racing saga. In this battle of good and evil, your car is your weapon; and with a huge arsenal of more than 130 vehicles to choose from, you have endless power within your grasp. Handle your cars with the unique style that established the &lt;b&gt;Driver&lt;/b&gt; series as a quintessential chase experience, with an all-new twist. Take the wheel with more control than ever, harnessing the incredible ability to instantly Shift to the exact car you need &#151; at the exact moment you need it. When you spot an enemy a block ahead, swap to a high-powered vehicle and throttle ahead to stop his getaway. When an opponent threatens to drive you off the road, take command of his vehicle and force his demise. Experience an even more enhanced Shift in the six online game modes, transporting yourself across miles in the blink of an eye with the ability to swap locations. Whether you're hunting down the bad guys, racing bumper-to-bumper against a friend or taking on skill-testing dares throughout the city streets, kick it into high gear, forget about the speed limit and don't hesitate for a split second &#151; or this ride could be your last.</longDescriptionHtml>

From writing lyrics on scraps of paper to battling in the clubs, you have held your head high throughout. You've freestyled with the best emcees around, created beats and dropped rhymes just to make it. You've been waiting for this moment your whole life and as the crowd chants your name you realize that the time has come. You grab the mic and as you rush onstage the crowd erupts with a roar, the lights go up and the beat drops &#151; you're a Rapstar.  Def Jam Rapstar gives players the opportunity to experience the essence of what hip-hop is &#151; the music, the battles and the swagger. Focusing exclusively on hip-hop, Def Jam Rapstar gives players the chance to become the star by rhyming, creating videos and sharing them with the world. Showcase your poetic prowess as you perform some of hip-hop's greatest songs or kick your own lyrics over beats composed by the industry's hottest producers. Sing and rap with a friend in Duet mode to achieve the highest combined score, or vie for hip-hop supremacy as you challenge them in Battle mode. Use your Xbox LIVE Vision camera to create a video of your performance and upload it online to share it with the world. Do you have what it takes to become a Rapstar?</longDescription>

But perhaps the secrets that are the most startling are those that are hidden away in your own family. You are a galactic trailblazer, a fearless adventurer of the future, leading the way through outer space. But as you sail through the stars, you are haunted by the dark mysteries that shroud your father. Blast off into the endless skies and explore a vast galaxy of extraterrestrial worlds on a quest to discover something that's even more alien &#151; your own past.  Take the helm of DarkStar One, a massive spacecraft, and launch into an adventure that will entail volatile space battles, cinematic drama and customized role-playing. As you enter into more than 300 solar systems populated by six unique alien races, you must choose whether to benevolently barter with the extraterrestrials, loot them of all of their goods as a space pirate or engage them in all-out warfare. Whatever way you choose, the results will reverberate throughout the universe &#151; and into your own life. Featuring totally immersive 3D combat action, wall-shaking surround sound and stunning high-definition visuals, DarkStar One: Broken Alliance transports you to the edges of the galaxy, into the deepest darkness you've ever encountered.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>Learn more about Homefront. (Flash demo) SynopsisHome used to be where the heart was. America used to be free. Now, home is nothing but a bleak landscape of walled towns and abandoned suburbs, where high school stadiums have become detention centers and shopping malls shelter armored attack vehicles. Fear and despair have crept into the United States that you knew and loved. Worldwide conflict, dwindling resources and economic crisis have taken their toll; and now, in 2027, the savage, nuclear-armed Greater Korean Republic clenches the US in a brutal occupation. But the enemy forgot one little thing about the USA: they may have seized our land and weakened our state, but no one can weaken the spirit of the American people.   Not since George Washington led the patriots in the Revolutionary War has America fought a battle so vital to the freedom of the nation and so close to the hearts of the people. Not since then have we had to band together to protect our Homefront. Take the front lines alongside the colorful characters of the Resistance as you employ daring guerrilla tactics, commandeer military vehicles and unleash epic warfare across sprawling battlefields with first-person sharpshooting action. The heart-pounding, hair-raising exhilaration of the struggle springs to life when you take the fight online and experience multiplayer infantry, helicopter and drone battles the likes of which you've never seen. Enter a ghost town where the residents have been relocated to nearby labor camps in the "Suburb" Xbox 360-exclusive multiplayer map. Featuring empty houses and buildings, this infantry- and drone-only map offers extensive cover locations while rooftops and tree houses make for ideal sniper locations. Mask your fear, take your weapon in hand and bear the title "American" with pride: this is the call to save your Homefront.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisIt has been more than 50 years since the Red Faction resistance and the Marauder allies liberated the Red Planet from the brutal Earth Defense Force &#151; however, that harmony is once again threatened. A massive Terraformer that supplies Mars with its Earth-like air and water has been destroyed, causing the once-balanced atmosphere to transform to chaos. The Colonists have been forced to flee underground and begin their lives beneath the surface. Darius Mason, the grandson of Martian Revolution heroes Alec Mason and Samanya, runs a dangerous, yet lucrative business carrying out jobs that others fear to do. When Darius is tricked into entering an old Marauder temple, he reopens a mysterious shaft &#151; releasing a long-sleeping evil that unleashes Armageddon across Mars. Only Darius and the Red Faction can protect the Colonist and Marauder settlements and save mankind from the evil that envelops the Red Planet.  Red Faction: Armageddon places you in the role of Darius Mason, a man born of Colonist and Marauder blood, who must save mankind from an unspeakable evil that has resurfaced. In the latest installment of the Red Faction franchise, you must travel across the storm-blasted Red Planet &#151; and below the surface as you take up arms against a terrifying new force that threatens the sake of mankind. Will you be able to uphold your family's tradition of fighting for the freedom of Mars to protect the settlements against this mysterious lethal force?</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisFor centuries, competitors in the Mortal Kombat Tournament have laid waste to their enemies as they attempted to be declared the winner. In the end, it was Emperor Shao Kahn that ruthlessly defeated Raiden and his allies. Unwilling to sit idly by, Raiden is determined to somehow defeat the Emperor and undo his victory. Raiden must go to a place where the Emperor is most vulnerable, a place where it is never too late for second chances. Raiden must go to the past.  The classic franchise returns with Mortal Kombat as you've never seen it before. Stereoscopic 3D creates a richly detailed world, complete with stunning 3D environments and characters and mind-blowing fatalities. Rewrite history as you battle your way through the Mortal Kombat Tournament. It's not just the legendary warriors that will be merciless and brutal. This time around, you'll be able to face your friends in traditional two-player matches or in several new game modes with three other friends to add to the excitement and gore. Do you have what it takes to alter the past and avoid extinction?</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisHe's the most ruthless crime lord to ever prowl the streets of the City by the Bay. His name is Charles Jericho, and he certainly did not bring his heart to San Francisco. Now the fate of the sunny city rests in the hands of one man: a detective, a hero, a Driver. John Tanner has put hundreds of criminals behind bars and chased injustice out of many a city, but this mission poses a threat like no other &#151; and could be his last. Step into the driver's seat as the hardened detective and get ready for a relentless manhunt that could end either with the restoration of justice or the setting of the sun on the Golden Gate Bridge forever.  Driver San Francisco puts the wheel back into your hands in the next installation of the classic racing saga. In this battle of good and evil, your car is your weapon; and with a huge arsenal of more than 130 vehicles to choose from, you have endless power within your grasp. Handle your cars with the unique style that established the Driver series as a quintessential chase experience, with an all-new twist. Take the wheel with more control than ever, harnessing the incredible ability to instantly Shift to the exact car you need &#151; at the exact moment you need it. When you spot an enemy a block ahead, swap to a high-powered vehicle and throttle ahead to stop his getaway. When an opponent threatens to drive you off the road, take command of his vehicle and force his demise. Experience an even more enhanced Shift in the six online game modes, transporting yourself across miles in the blink of an eye with the ability to swap locations. Whether you're hunting down the bad guys, racing bumper-to-bumper against a friend or taking on skill-testing dares throughout the city streets, kick it into high gear, forget about the speed limit and don't hesitate for a split second &#151; or this ride could be your last.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisYou're exhausted. You've performed counterstrikes to every one of your opponent's strikes. You've grappled with him, bringing him to his knees. The last aerial attack landed square on his head. Now he's dazed and you know the crowd is yours. They're cheering you on, begging you to perform your most deadly move &#151; and win the match.  Welcome to the world of Mexico's premiere wrestling federation, AAA, where luchadores compete in highly acrobatic combat, fighting on either the side of the Tecnico, the good guys, or Rudo, the bad guys. Create your own character by choosing from a massive collection of customizable clothes, accessories and body characteristics, or take on opponents as any of the real-life luchadores featured in the AAA League. You don't know wrestling until you've taken part in this sophisticated system of strikes and counterstrikes, grapples, extreme aerial assaults and character-specific specialty moves. In this adrenaline-pumped sports game, unleashing all the right moves won't be enough &#151; you'll have to gain the support of the crowd in order to win the match. Wager your mask and hair in an online winner-take-all battle against humiliation with up to four players. But don't forget, in Heroes Del Ring, the crowd determines the winners and the losers &#151; you better hope they like you.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisThe air is thick, and the lights are low. You stand offstage reflecting on everything you've gone through. From writing lyrics on scraps of paper to battling in the clubs, you have held your head high throughout. You've freestyled with the best emcees around, created beats and dropped rhymes just to make it. You've been waiting for this moment your whole life and as the crowd chants your name you realize that the time has come. You grab the mic and as you rush onstage the crowd erupts with a roar, the lights go up and the beat drops &#151; you're a Rapstar.  Def Jam Rapstar gives players the opportunity to experience the essence of what hip-hop is &#151; the music, the battles and the swagger. Focusing exclusively on hip-hop, Def Jam Rapstar gives players the chance to become the star by rhyming, creating videos and sharing them with the world. Showcase your poetic prowess as you perform some of hip-hop's greatest songs or kick your own lyrics over beats composed by the industry's hottest producers. Sing and rap with a friend in Duet mode to achieve the highest combined score, or vie for hip-hop supremacy as you challenge them in Battle mode. Use your Xbox LIVE Vision camera to create a video of your performance and upload it online to share it with the world. Do you have what it takes to become a Rapstar?</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisThe dark expanses of the universe hold endless secrets, unimaginable to man. But perhaps the secrets that are the most startling are those that are hidden away in your own family. You are a galactic trailblazer, a fearless adventurer of the future, leading the way through outer space. But as you sail through the stars, you are haunted by the dark mysteries that shroud your father. Blast off into the endless skies and explore a vast galaxy of extraterrestrial worlds on a quest to discover something that's even more alien &#151; your own past.  Take the helm of DarkStar One, a massive spacecraft, and launch into an adventure that will entail volatile space battles, cinematic drama and customized role-playing. As you enter into more than 300 solar systems populated by six unique alien races, you must choose whether to benevolently barter with the extraterrestrials, loot them of all of their goods as a space pirate or engage them in all-out warfare. Whatever way you choose, the results will reverberate throughout the universe &#151; and into your own life. Featuring totally immersive 3D combat action, wall-shaking surround sound and stunning high-definition visuals, DarkStar One: Broken Alliance transports you to the edges of the galaxy, into the deepest darkness you've ever encountered.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisIt's game seven, tie game and there are only eight seconds remaining on the clock. Your teammate inbounds the ball to you, and you start to dribble up the floor crossing midcourt. Quickly you cross over and head to the left as the center sets a hard pick &#151; knocking your defender off his feet. Seven seconds to go. You pass to the wing and cut to the right. Seconds continue to tick away as the forward comes up to set a screen. Your defender recovers and rushes up to cover you just as you receive the ball at the top of the three-point arc. You pump fake &#151; he doesn't budge. You decide to put the ball on the deck and dribble to the right &#151; three seconds to go. You stop and cross over to your left, causing the defender to lose his balance. You rise into the air and release the ball. Two seconds &#151; flashbulbs pop and the crowd holds its collective breath. One second &#151; the ball approaches the hoop, will there be overtime or glory?  NBA 2K11 builds on the momentum of NBA 2K10 by improving every aspect of the series. In addition to the authentic professional basketball experience, NBA 2K11 pays homage to 14-time NBA All-Star and six-time NBA World Champion, Michael Jordan. Put your hoop skills to the ultimate test as you attempt to relive 10 legendary games from Jordan's career and replicate his athletic feats on the hardwood in the Jordan Challenge. Successfully reenact all 10 scenarios to unlock the MJ: Creating a Legend a mode which allows you to take control of a newly drafted rookie Michael Jordan &#151; and create your own historical career in the NBA. Have you ever wondered how the Jordan-led Chicago Bulls would fare against today's NBA teams? The legendary Bulls squads from the 1985-1986, 1989-90, 1990-91, 1991-92, 1994-95, 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98 seasons are at your fingertips in Quick Game mode. Hit game milestones and accomplishments as you play through the game to earn and collect pairs of Air Jordan shoes that Michael wore throughout his legendary career. Take full control of the ball with the all-new IsoMotion Dribbling controls and Dynamic Shot control allowing you to unleash ankle-breaking moves to separate from your defender, drive to the hole, pull up and hit the open jumper, lay the ball in gently or slam it home. With new and improved features, including My Career mode, in-game highlights, side-by-side commentary, dynamic crowd attendance and an exciting soundtrack, NBA 2K11 delivers all the realism, excitement and energy of the NBA.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisA dark international conspiracy, run by the most elusive and dangerous criminal masterminds in the world, has seeped its way into the UK. A secretive bio-chemical project, the likes of which could propel humanity to new heights &#151; or wreak complete devastation across the world &#151; hangs in the balance. One thing is for sure: to prevent worldwide catastrophe, it's going to take a man with the instincts of a killer, the fearlessness of hero, the craft of a secret agent &#151; and the suave moves of a Casanova. And that man is Bond. James Bond.  You rip through traffic, throttling into full gear on a bridge high above the water. You handbrake-turn around obstacles as cars explode in fiery orbs. Gunfire shatters your windows as attack vehicles to your right and left unleash bullet after bullet. Coolly, you press ahead. This is your job. As you step into the shined shoes and crisp suit of the double agent who defined generations, the mission is deadlier, the action is more sweeping and your enemy is more secretive than ever before. Embark on a mission that will jet you to the rooftops of Athens, the casinos of Monaco and beyond in an international chase that will demand precise gun handling, gritty hand-to-hand combat and secret-agent strategy. In this continuation of James Bond cinematic splendor, the writer of GoldenEye and Tomorrow Never Dies delivers a thrilling new storyline, led by Daniel Craig, Judi Dench and Joss Stone. The deadly action is even bigger online as you join 15 other gamers to skillfully maneuver the mission in teams. Suit up, load up and ensure your enemies get shaken &#151; not stirred.</longDescription>

Revolutionary body-tracking technology puts your body on-screen and you in charge of the workout, creating an intuitive, customized experience.

    <longDescription>Learn more about Kinect Joy Ride. (Flash demo) SynopsisThe power of a high-speed racer is completely harnessed in one place &#151; your own body. It's three, two, one, and you're hurtling around the race track, missiles whizzing past your windows, rivals revving and pummeling at your bumper. A sharp corner takes you by surprise &#151; you twist your torso with all your might and jet ahead, escaping a fiery demise. Your sister pulls up close behind, but you won't let her take the lead &#151; you pump your hands back and forth and leave her in the dust. No doubt about it, the power of a champion courses through your fuel lines.  Ditch the controller and really take the driver's seat in the crazy courses of Kinect Joy Ride. When you're powered by the revolutionary body-tracking technology of Kinect, you're in control of the very best racing navigator there is &#151; you. Perform gravity-defying, mind-blowing stunts high in the air. Speed through three new worlds. Hunt for power boosts and set up traps for your opponents. Let your friends join the race just by jumping in and starting to steer. Classic kart-racing action is super powered and intuitively progressive now that it's blended with the excitement of Kinect, and one thing's for sure &#151; this is one Joy Ride that isn't on cruise control.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>Learn more about Kinectimals. (Flash demo) SynopsisThe most exotic, most adorable cubs are leaving the zoo, and this time, they're headed right into your home, into your heart and into your very own hands. Teach a baby tiger to play games and do tricks. Pet his head when he wants to be comforted. Call his name and watch him run over to you and give you his attention. Give your new fuzzy friend care and love, and you'll be sure to get some in return. These Kinectimals may be wild, but they're also wildly loveable.  Kinectimals invites you to become the proud new parent of an exotic baby animal, and asks you to give it a happy home. Choose a furry friend of your very own from five cute critters, give it a name and get ready for a brand-new friendship. Thanks to the motion-sensing technology of Kinect, your virtual pet will feel your strokes as you pet it and hear your words when you talk to him or her, bringing the two of you together in a close friendship &#151; especially when you take home a plush version of your pet that you can love on both sides of the TV monitor. Train your Kinectimal to listen to your commands, and take it to competitions where you can both show off the skills you've learned together. Wild animals don't always belong at the zoo &#151; these will stay in the apple of your eye.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>Learn more about Kinect Sports. (Flash demo) SynopsisJump into the court, charge into the stadium and climb into the ring &#151; there's a major sports competition going on, and you're at the center of the action. When the volleyball rockets through the air toward the edge of the boundary line, dive toward the ground, scoop your arms down and bump it up for your teammate to spike with all of her might. When you hear your opponent breathing down your neck, step it up and jump even faster over hurdles. When you sense a weak moment in the boxing ring, jab your rival in the stomach and watch him fall to the ground. You have the power to win &#151; it's been in your body all along.  The real all-stars of sports don't use buttons or joysticks on the paths to victory &#151; so why should you? Leave your controller in the locker room and step out into the competition with the best tool you have &#151; yourself. In Kinect Sports, real athletic action springs to life in your living room, and it's all controlled with the motions you make. Revolutionary motion-sensing technology recognizes you as you power through six intense sports, making you a true athletic champion. Whether you play on your own or on a team, Kinect Sports will test your limits and bring you glory &#151; if you can handle the action.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisYou slash your way through a dense and dangerous forest, patches of light dappling through the thick canopy of leaves above you. Out of nowhere, a crack of thunder tears across the sky and pounds in your ears. The sky blackens as heavy drops of rain blast through the trees and pound on your head and shoulders. You can't see anything, but you press onward &#151; you have a mission to complete. You feign fearlessness as you push through the thicket &#151; until, out of the darkness, a hand grabs your shoulder.  Welcome to Arcania. In this vivid and perilous world, the lines between the real and the imagined are blurred. Once you step into this deep and ever-changing universe, stunning light, weather and sound effects so sophisticated and lifelike will suck you in &#151; and you'll never quite leave. Shroud yourself in layers of the strongest armor, designed by you, and wield deadly weapons as you march into battle. Master complicated attacks so evolved you'll forget you're even playing a game. As you skillfully sneak through intricate castles, expansive cities and vibrant flora, prepare to meet deep, secretive characters that you'll never be able to forget &#151; even if you wish that you could.</longDescription>

    <longDescription>SynopsisNo one ever said the gang life was easy &#151; but it certainly isn't boring, either. Descend into the teeming, gritty city streets of StilWater and get ready to lead a life that's anything but stagnant &#151; as a member of the 3rd Street Saints. The most devious Saints ever to grace the city streets must conquer the city and prove their prowess, or fall to the hands of rival forces. Experience the entire street epic &#151; from the first brawls and dangerous missions to a full-out attack on encroaching corporations &#151; in the Saints Row Platinum Hits Double Pack.  First, plunge into the dynamic, fully living city of StilWater in Saints Row, where you'll experience next gen movie-quality special effects, immersive lighting and multiplayer mayhem that began the multimillion unit-selling series. Choose your paths and your actions with care in this freeform world, where every move you make has real consequences. Saints Row 2 takes you back to that world with even more combat, more vehicles and more excitement. Shape your StilWater experience with fully customizable characters, vehicles, cribs and even gangs. Share the thrills and dangers with additional players as you barrel through the streets in the same vehicle, fighting a common enemy, or battle each other in an environment fully populated with police, innocent bystanders and rival gangs. Virtually any vehicle becomes a weapon in your resourceful hands, including planes, helicopters and cars. With this double pack of street-fighting escapades, StilWater will never be the same again.</longDescription>
