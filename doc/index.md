To get started with agile data science using Antelope we encourage you to download the code and train a model, following the instructions in the demo sections. This is something you can do in about 15 minutes.

After gaining familiarity with the basic workflow see our guides to gain a deeper understanding of how Antelope works and how you can use it. The current release (v0.2) is not suitable for production deployments but can be used for data science competitions or in prototype applications.
